# Electric Vehicle Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This project is an **interactive Excel dashboard** that analyzes the adoption and growth of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**.  
The goal is to uncover key insights about EV trends, state-wise adoption, vehicle categories, and yearly growth.  

It demonstrates how Excel can be used to solve **business problems** and support **data-driven decision-making** in the clean energy and automotive sector.

##  Problem Statement
The global shift towards sustainable energy has increased the demand for **Electric Vehicles**, but businesses, policymakers, and researchers face challenges in understanding:  
- Which states or regions are adopting EVs fastest?  
- What types of EVs (Battery Electric vs Hybrid) dominate the market?  
- How quickly is the EV market growing year over year?  

Without clear insights, it is difficult to plan **manufacturing, infrastructure, charging stations, and policy incentives**.

##  Why I Did This Project
I built this dashboard to:  
- Practice **data analysis and visualization** using Excel.  
- Understand how EV adoption trends vary across geographies.  
- Provide a simple tool for **decision-makers and analysts** to explore the EV landscape interactively.  

---

##  What Problem I Solved
This dashboard solves the problem of **raw data complexity** by transforming it into an easy-to-use, interactive visual report.  
Instead of manually analyzing large datasets, stakeholders can now:  
- Track EV growth trends at a glance  
- Identify top-performing states in EV adoption  
- Compare Battery Electric vs Hybrid vehicles  
- Spot market opportunities and growth patterns  

---

##  Business Understanding
For governments, EV manufacturers, and infrastructure companies:  
- **Governments** can identify regions with low EV penetration and plan incentives.  
- **Manufacturers** can forecast demand for different EV categories.  
- **Charging infrastructure providers** can prioritize states with rapid EV adoption.  

This project turns **raw data into business insights** that support better planning and investment decisions.
